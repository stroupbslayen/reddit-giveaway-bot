What is the point of the Random Giveaway Bot?

Giveaway bot was made to to random giveaways, obviously. I alway see people giving away things on Reddit because Redditors are some of the most awesome and generous people around.
But I was always seeing problems with people being able to fairly randomly pick people. I'm not a programmer so I'm sure there's a better way of doing things, plus this is my first bot so give me a break :P

Fill in the config file with your login info, subreddit to monitor, and bot name and you're good to go!
